# Quantumania

### Inspiration:
- Quantum chemistry  has helped to advance other areas of science and technology. For example, it has been used to design new drugs, develop more efficient catalysts for industrial processes, and understand the properties of materials used in electronic devices [^1]

- The limiting factor of Classical models is you have to pick a certain area where you have to compromise on accuracy to stay within the computational limit. Each simplification  reduces the overall accuracy  of your model. "The coarser your data , the more labor intensive your lab work"[^2] 

- Now even in the NISQ era of Quantum computer , we have quantum algos such as VQE[^3]  which has ability to speed up optimization problems and efficient simulations of complex molecules.We intend to go more deeper into this problem

- As a part of Quantum Chemistry Challenge[^4], we  tried to tackle the ground state problem of BeH2 molecule
